    <H2>CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole</H2>

    <p>
        <b>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank</b>, and of having nothing to do: once or twice 
        <strong>she had peeped into the book her sister was reading</strong>, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of 
        a book,<mark>” thought Alice “without pictures or conversations?” </mark>
    </p>

    <p><u>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could</u>, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), 
        whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when 
        suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. 
    </p>

    <p>There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit
         say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she 
         ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch 
         out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her
          mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with
           curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under 
           the hedge. </p>
